# Serradura

Serradura also known as sawdust pudding, or Macau pudding, is a well-known Portuguese dessert, popular in both Portugal and Macau which shows a layered outlook with a simple combination of whipped cream and crumbled Marie biscuit. The name Serradura is a Portuguese word for “sawdust”, which refers to the way the biscuits look in the pudding, as they are crushed very fine into crumbs.
